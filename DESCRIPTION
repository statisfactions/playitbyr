Description: playitbyr is a flexible toolkit for data sonification,
    with syntax modeled after the ggplot2 package. The functions allow
    the user to map data onto sonic parameters like pitch, tempo, and
    rhythm, and output sound and sound files.

SystemRequirements: playitbyr creates sound using the csound package, currently broken, 
    which requires the free and open source software synthesizer
    Csound, available at <http://csound.com/download/>. See
